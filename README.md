CISPA-HR-3523
=============

Requests for comments / patches to CISPA or HR 3523, Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act

Background:
-----------

We've recently had conversations with a couple of the house staffers that have been responsible for the CISPA legislation, and they've expressed big concerns that the bill will be sidelines or waylaid...

foo.. bazz... bat...  ( Need to insert a lot more details here.... )

Purpose:
--------

To give the geek community a chance to look at the current bill, make comments, and if possible create improvements to the bill by submitting comments and / or patches.  

Will this work?
---------------

Who knows, but it's better than having a total crap bill, isn't it?

Here's the link to the current version:

And the report on the previous version is here:

We'd really appreciate getting feedback from the community on the bill and we are currently still discussing these issues with groups like CDT also and may make some changes.

In addition, no matter what happens this week in the House, we are far from the end of this process and we hope to keep working with you and the community to get this right.
