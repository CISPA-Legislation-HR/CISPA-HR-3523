=============

Requests for comments / patches to CISPA or HR 3523, Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act

We've recently had conversations with a couple of the house staffers that have been responsible for the CISPA legislation, and they've expressed big concerns that the bill will be sidelines or waylaid...

foo.. bazz... bat...

Purpose:
--------

To give the geek community a chance to look at the current bill, make comments, and if possible create improvements to the bill by submitting comments and / or patches.  

Will this work?
---------------

Who knows, but it's better than having a total crap bill, isn't it?
