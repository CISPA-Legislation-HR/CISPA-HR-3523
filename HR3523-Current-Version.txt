            ‘‘(ii) a person with an appropriate se-
            curity clearance to receive such cyber 
            threat intelligence;

        protect the national security of the United 
        States; and 
        ‘‘(C) used by a certified entity in a manner 
        which protects such cyber threat intelligence 
        from unauthorized disclosure.

 THREAT INTELLIGENCE.—Notwithstanding any 
 other provision of law, a certified entity receiving
